# A function is a collection of ststements whic perform a specific task.
# Functions are used to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces.
# Functions can take inputs (arguments) and return outputs (results).

# Functions can be defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.

# A function that says hello to the user
def say_hi(): # After the colons, all the code that comes after is going to be part of the function. We therefore have to indent it.
    print("Hello user!")

# For us to execture the function, we have to call it. 
# This is done by writing the function name followed by parentheses.

say_hi() # Output: Hello user!
