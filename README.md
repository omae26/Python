# Python
This is my journey of learning Python the right way. By the end of this journey I would have learnt a lot about this language that I have always wanted to learn. Yayy to me for taking the first step (starting)
This is the order of how I have been learning. I am documenting it here since there are some simple projects I'm doing along the way, that need to be in a separate respository, yet my plan initially was to store everything in one repository. Lo and behold! I had not known the secret,but now I know one of the way of increasing my contributions here.
So this is the order:

# Variables
Variables are used to store values
They can only store one value of a single type 
When creating a variable, we have to give the name of the variable
Data types: Strings (text), Numbers(whole, decimal), Boolean (True or False)

# Strings
Strings are a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
They can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes
They are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created
To change a string, you must create a new string

# Working with Numbers
Under this I handled various operators, How to store numbers in a variable, How to convert a number into a string, and how to use various functions like abs(), pow() etc

# Getting input from user
Using the input() function to get inputs from users
The input function returns a string, so we have to convert it to a number if we want to perform arithmetic operations on it

# Building a simple calculator
I built a simple calculator that can perform addition, and also identifies the numbers as integers or decimal
The goal is to improve it and make it more comple as time goes by
The bit of gettinginput from user came in handy while working on this

# Mad Libs Game
This is a simple game that asks the user to input random words, and a story is created from the words input by the user.

# Lists in python
List store more than one value at a single time,and they can be of deffernt types
That is the most distinguihing difference between lists and variables
Square brackets are used to store elements in a tuple.

# Tuples in python
Tuples are similar to list only that they are immutable. Once elements are added to a tuple, they can't be changed. It is often used to store elements that cannot change.
Parenthesis are used to store elements in a tuple.

# Functions in python
Functions are a collection of statements which perform a specific task.
They are defined using the 'def' keyword.

# Return Statements
These statements are used to make a function that has been called, return a particular value.

# If statements
They are used to execute decisions in python based on some conditions
