# Python
This is my journey of learning Python the right way. By the end of this journey I would have learnt a lot about this language that I have always wanted to learn. Yayy to me for taking the first step (starting)
This is the order of how I have been learning. I am documenting it here since there are some simple projects I'm doing along the way, that need to be in a separate respository, yet my plan initially was to store everything in one repository. Lo and behold! I had not known the secret,but now I know one of the way of increasing my contributions here.
So this is the order:
# Variables
# Strings
# Working with NUmbers
# Getting input from user
# Building a simple calculator
# Mad Libs Game
# Lists in python
