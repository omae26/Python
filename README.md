# Python
This is my journey of learning Python the right way. By the end of this journey I would have learnt a lot about this language that I have always wanted to learn. Yayy to me for taking the first step (starting)
This is the order of how I have been learning. I am documenting it here since there are some simple projects I'm doing along the way, that need to be in a separate respository, yet my plan initially was to store everything in one repository. Lo and behold! I had not known the secret,but now I know one of the way of increasing my contributions here.
So this is the order:

# Variables
Variables are used to store values
They can only store one value of a single type 
When creating a variable, we have to give the name of the variable
Data types: Strings (text), Numbers(whole, decimal), Boolean (True or False)

# Strings
Strings are a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
They can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes
They are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created
To change a string, you must create a new string

# Working with Numbers
Under this I handled various operators, How to store numbers in a variable, How to convert a number into a string, and how to use various functions like abs(), pow() etc

# Getting input from user
Using the input() function to get inputs from users
The input function returns a string, so we have to convert it to a number if we want to perform arithmetic operations on it

# Building a simple calculator
# Mad Libs Game
# Lists in python
List store more than one value at a single time,and they can be of deffernt types
That is the most distinguihing difference between lists and variables
